Connect Four -  TravelRepublic front-end developer test
==========================================================

* What is Connect Four?
Connect Four is a
** two-player connection game in which the
*** players first choose a color
*** and then take turns
**** dropping one colored disc from the top into a
*****  seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid.
*****  The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column.
*** The objective of the game is to be the first to form a
**** diagonal line of four of one's own discs.
***** horizontal
***** vertical
***** diagonal

 More info can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four.

* What do I need to do?
** Players take turns
*** in each turn
**** DONE one player has the right to drop a token into any column which is not filled
     CLOSED: [2019-11-17 Sun 22:54]
*** DONE The game is finished as soon as one of the players satisfies the victory conditions.
    CLOSED: [2019-11-17 Sun 22:53]
**** At that point the game
***** TODO can be restarted,
***** TODO the players can return to the starting screen.

* Some additional details regarding the task
** On the starting screen
*** [EITHER] the players should be able to
**** DONE enter their names and select the colour of their tokens
     CLOSED: [2019-11-17 Sun 22:53]
**** DONE continue with the default names and colours (e.g. Player 1 with blue colour, and Player 2 with red colour, or per your own choice).
     CLOSED: [2019-11-17 Sun 22:53]

** On each player turn,
*** TODO a timer should keep track of how long it took that player to make all his moves.
*** At the beginning of each turn,
**** timer for the currently active player
***** TODO should start counting time and
***** TODO stop only when the player places a token into a column.
**** DONE Who is the active player should be clearly indicated in the UI.
     CLOSED: [2019-11-17 Sun 22:53]

** The number of wins for each player should also be tracked.
*** If the game is restarted,
**** TODO it should be reflected in the UI by incrementing the number of wins for the winning player.
*** If the players decide to return to the starting screen after the last round of the game
**** TODO these values should be reset.


** Round-end screen should
*** TODO clearly indicate the winner (if there is a winner),
*** TODO current score between the two players,
*** and provide options for
**** TODO restarting the game
**** TODO or going to the start screen.
*** If the game is restarted,
**** TODO the player that had won the previous round should be the second to play, while the player that lost the previous round should be the first to play.

* Tools, frameworks and solution
  You can use whatever frameworks or libraries you like, but be prepared to justify your use of them.
  Ideally, we would like to see a solution based on one of the industry standard frameworks, use of CSS preprocessor and a module bundler (e.g. Webpack). It is also recommended that Git VCS is used,
** TODO and that the solution contains a „readme“ file with all the important information, for example how to install/build/run/test your solution.

* How much time do I have?
  You should aim to get this test back to us within four days of receiving this task, but there is no precise time limit.

* How to submit the solution?
  If you have a GitHub account, the easiest way would be to upload it there, and then share a link with us. If that's not an option then put all the relevant files into a single archive (.rar or .zip) and send it back as an attachement.
