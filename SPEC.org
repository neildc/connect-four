* Tools, frameworks and solution
  You can use whatever frameworks or libraries you like, but be prepared to justify your use of them.
  Ideally, we would like to see a solution based on one of the industry standard frameworks, use of CSS preprocessor and a module bundler (e.g. Webpack). It is also recommended that Git VCS is used,
** TODO and that the solution contains a „readme“ file with all the important information, for example how to install/build/run/test your solution.

* How much time do I have?
  You should aim to get this test back to us within four days of receiving this task, but there is no precise time limit.

* How to submit the solution?
  If you have a GitHub account, the easiest way would be to upload it there, and then share a link with us. If that's not an option then put all the relevant files into a single archive (.rar or .zip) and send it back as an attachement.
