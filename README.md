A recreation of the classic connect 4 board game in Elm.

Demo: http://neildc.github.io/connect-four/ 

The logic isn't tied to the size of the board or the amount of players, but currently isn't user configurable.
It also isn't styled responsively to deal with the larger board, so you may need to zoom out. It works though!

Demo (bigger board & 4 players) : http://neildc.github.io/connect-four-alt/

Running the app:

```
yarn global add create-elm-app
elm-app start
```

This project is bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).
