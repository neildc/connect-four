A recreation of the classic connect 4 board game in Elm.

Demo: http://neildc.github.io/connect-four/ 

The logic isn't tied to a fixed size of the board or the amount of players, but currently isn't user configurable. So here's another build with those constants twiddled with if you want to see the madness that this game could potentially be.

Demo (bigger board & 4 players) : http://neildc.github.io/connect-four-alt/

Running the app:

```
yarn global add create-elm-app
elm-app start
```

This project is bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).
